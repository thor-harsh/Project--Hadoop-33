**In this project We will use MapReduce with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here We will calculate total amount spent by customer based on the dataset given and will sort it**.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark first**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.<br></br>

**What is Spark SQL**?<br></br>
Spark SQL lets you query structured data inside Spark programs, using either SQL or a familiar DataFrame API. Usable in Java, Scala, Python and R.
DataFrames and SQL provide a common way to access a variety of data sources, including Hive, Avro, Parquet, ORC, JSON, and JDBC. You can even join data across these sources.
Spark SQL supports the HiveQL syntax as well as Hive SerDes and UDFs, allowing you to access existing Hive warehouses.<br></br>

Spark SQL includes a cost-based optimizer, columnar storage and code generation to make queries fast. At the same time, it scales to thousands of nodes and multi hour queries using the Spark engine, which provides full mid-query fault tolerance. Don't worry about using a different engine for historical data.<br></br>


**What is Cosine Similarity**?<br></br>
In data analysis, cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors defined in an inner product space. Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors; that is, it is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths.<br></br>
